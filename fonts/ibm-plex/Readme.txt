## IBM Plex fonts

To retrieve  the IBM PLex Mono fonts and use them for  MicroEmacs  you need to
switch into the folder  _ibm-plex_  execute the script  `install-ibm-fonts.sh`
using the Bash shell like this:

```
bash install-ibm-fonts.sh
```

Thereafter  you  should  be able to see the IBM fonts  available  for X11 font
selection with tools like  _xfontsel_. To have them available  after a restart
fo your X11  session you should move them to a folder  belonging  to your font
path. Please read the file fonts/README.md for details.
