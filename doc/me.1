.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
MicroEmacs 2009 is a cut down version of the EMACS text editor, based on
Danial Lawrences MicroEmacs.
MicroEmacs is a tool for creating and changing documents, programs, and
other text files.
It is both relatively easy for the novice to use, but also very powerful
in the hands of an expert.
MicroEmacs can be extensively customized for the needs of the individual
user.
.PP
MicroEmacs allows multiple files to be edited at the same time.
The screen may be split into different windows and screens, and text may
be moved freely from one window on any screen to the next.
Depending on the type of file being edited, MicroEmacs can change how it
behaves to make editing simple.
Editing standard text files, program files and word processing documents
are all possible at the same time.
.PP
There are extensive capabilities to make word processing and editing
easier.
These include commands for string searching and replacing, paragraph
reformatting and deleting, automatic word wrapping, word move and
deletes, easy case controlling, and auto-matic word counts.
.PP
For complex and repetitive editing tasks editing macros can be written.
These macros allow the user a great degree of flexibility in determining
how MicroEmacs behaves.
Also, any and all the commands can be used by any key stroke by
changing, or re-binding, what commands various keys invoke.
.PP
Special features are also available to perform a diverse set of
operations such as file encryption, automatic backup file gen\[hy]
eration, en-tabbing and de-tabbing lines, executing operating system
commands and filtering of text through other programs.
.PP
The command line options to MicroEmacs are defined as follows:-
.TP
\[at]startFile
Initialize MicroEmacs 2009 using startFile[.emf].
The default when omitted is me.emf.
See and for more information.
.TP
-
Pipe stdin into buffer \f[I]stdin\f[R], when the buffer is saved the
output is written stdout.
Following is a simple example which changes \[cq]a\[cq]s to
\[cq]b\[cq]s:
.RS
.PP
define-macro start-up find-buffer \[lq]\f[I]stdin\f[R]\[rq]
beginning-of-buffer replace-string \[lq]a\[rq] \[lq]b\[rq] save-buffer
quick-exit !emacro
.RE
.RS
.PP
This can be used in the following manner:
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
   me \[dq]\[at]testpipe.emf\[dq] < foo.a > foo.b
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
See -p for disabling user interaction and the help page for command for
a further example.
.RE
.TP
-a
Toggle the auto-save mode, this toggles the mode.
.RS
.PP
Note: that NanoEmacs disables auto save mode by default and MicroEmacs
enables auto save mode by default.
The behavior of -a is therefore different between the two editors.
.RE
.TP
-A
When running in a UNIX console this option disabled the use of the
alternative screen buffer.
By default MicroEmacs will restore the console text when suspended or
exited if the terminal supports the alternative screen buffer feature.
.TP
-b
Load next file as a binary file (binary editor mode, uses buffer mode).
.TP
-B
Toggle the backup mode, this toggles the mode.
.RS
.PP
Note: that NanoEmacs disables backup mode by default and MicroEmacs
enables backup mode by default.
The behavior of -B is therefore different between the two editors.
.RE
.TP
-c[sessionName]
Continuation mode.
Load the MicroEmacs 2009 last edit session, restoring the buffers to
their previous loaded state when history mode is enabled.
The -c option is generally used with windowing interfaces
(X-Windows/Microsoft Windows) as the shortcut icon invocation.
.RS
.PP
If the optional session name sessionName is specified then the session
file sessionName.esf is loaded restoring the previ\[hy] ous editing
session including the buffer window size, position and layout, the
buffer mark and cursor location, main window size.
When the sessionName includes space characters then the command line
option should be bracketed e.g.\  \[lq]-cFoo Bar\[rq].
.RE
.RS
.PP
On a session restore then no additional files to load should be included
on the command line as this will not enable the original window
configuration to be restored as the window configuration will change.
See for further information.
.RE
.RS
.PP
If the sessionName is omitted then the default session file username.esf
is loaded (see restoring the previously loaded buffers however the
window layout and position is not restored.
The default sessionName is the login name
.RE
.TP
-h
Show the help page (does not start the editor).
.TP
-f
Stop processing command-line arguments, instead set a variable for all
following arguments.
.TP
-i
MS-DOS versions of MicroEmacs 2009 only.
Insert the contents of the current screen into the \f[I]scratch\f[R]
buffer
.TP
-k[key]
Load next file as an encrypted file (uses buffer mode).
The optional adjoining argument can be used to specify the decrypting
key, if this argument is not specify the user will be prompted for it on
start-up.
.TP
-llineNo[:column]
Go to line lineNo in the next given file and optionally to the specified
column number.
The column may be omitted if not required.
Typically used with utilities such a where an external editor may be
invoked from other viewer.
.TP
-mcommand
Sends a command to an existing MicroEmacs session.
.PD 0
.P
.PD
The command takes the form \[lq]C:<client>:<command>\[rq] i.e.\ to write
\[lq]Hello World\[rq] on the message line then a client may issue the
command:-
.RS
.PP
; launch server me & ; send message me -m \[lq]C:ME:ml-write \[dq]Hello
world\[dq]\[rq]
.RE
.RS
.PP
Note that the is a MicroEmacs macro command, the escape sequences must
be adhered to.
The client-server interface is typically used to load a file, this may
be performed as follows:-
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    me -m \[dq]C:myutility:find-file \[rs]\[dq]/path/foo.bar\[rs]\[dq]\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
The absolute path is specified in this type of transaction as the
current working directory of the active MicroEmacs session is unknown.
The -m option de-iconize\[cq]s the existing editor session and bring it
to the foreground.
.RE
.TP
-n
UNIX X-Windows environments only and MicroSoft Windows NT console
versions.
Execute MicroEmacs 2009 using termcap rather than X-Windows for UNIX;
typically used within an xterm shell to fire up MicroEmacs 2009 for a
quick edit.
For Microsoft Windows, a console window is started as opposed to a GUI
window.
.TP
-o<file>
Use already running version of MicroEmacs 2009 to load the <file>, if it
exists, otherwise start a new editor session.
This uses the client-server interface to push the new file into the
existing editor session.
Refer to the for details.
.TP
-p
Used with the - which inputs from stdin and disables user interaction
within MicroEmacs.
To debug then the -P option may be used to enable debug on stderr.
See the help pages for commands and for examples of this option\[cq]s
use.
.TP
-P
Used with the -p option and is used for debugging the pipe mode,
messages are displayed on stderr.
.TP
-R
Reverse the default video color scheme.
The default foreground color becomes the background color and vice
versa.
This only affects the built in scheme and not any schemes defined in any
start-up file.
.TP
-r
Read-only, all buffers will be in view mode
.TP
-sstring
Search for string \[lq]string\[rq] in the current buffer.
e.g.\ starts MicroEmacs 2009, loads file bar and initiates a search for
foo.
The cursor is left at the end of the string if located, otherwise at the
top of the buffer.
.TP
-uusername
Set the current user name to username before MicroEmacs is initialized.
.TP
-vvariable=string
Assign the MicroEmacs 2009 variable with string.
The assignment is performed before the buffers are loaded.
Typically used to change the start-up characteristics of the startup
file(s).
.TP
-V
Print the name and version of MicroEmacs.
i.e.
.RS
.PP
orac% me -V MicroEmacs 06 - Date 2006/08/10 - sunos
.RE
.TP
-x
UNIX environments.
Disable the capture of signals.
MicroEmacs 2009 by default captures an handles all illicit signal
in\[hy] terrupts.
The option is enabled when debugging the source code allowing exception
conditions to be trapped within the debugger.
.TP
-y
Load next file as a reduced binary file (uses buffer mode).
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables are used by MicroEmacs 2009.
.TP
\f[B]DISPLAY\f[R]
UNIX environments running X-Windows only.
The identity of the X-Windows server.
Typically set to unix:0.0, refer to the X-Windows documentation for
details of this environment variable.
.TP
\f[B]MENAME\f[R]
is used to override the identity of the user.
The variable may be used to determine which start-up configuration to
use in the initialization of MicroEmacs 2009 ($user-name.erf).
This is ignored if the -u option is specified on the command line.
.RS
.PP
Non-UNIX platforms usually need to explicitly set the $MENAME
environment variable to identify the aforementioned files.
for MS-DOS and early versions of Microsoft Windows this is typically
performed in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]PATH\f[R]
The $PATH environment variable is used on most operating systems as a
search path for executable files.
This $PATH environ\[hy] ment variable must be defined with MicroEmacs
2009 on the search path.
Under UNIX this is set in the .login, .cshrc or .profile file i.e.
.RS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export PATH $PATH:/usr/name/me
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.RS
.PP
Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
e.g.
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    set PATH=%PATH%;c:\[rs]me
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
MicroEmacs 2009 utilizes information in the $PATH environment variable
to locate the start-up files, dictionaries etc.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]TERM\f[R]
The terminal identification sting.
In UNIX environments the environment variable $TERM is set to
\[lq]vt\&...\[rq], in this case it is assumed that the machine is a
server, and the host cannot support X (see command line option -n).
.RS
.PP
In MS-DOS the environment variable is usually set to define the graphics
adapter mode.
%TERM is assigned a string, understood by the me.emf start-up file, to
set the graphics mode.
Predefined strings include:-
.RE
.RS
.PP
E80x50 Initiates an 80 column by 50 line screen.
.RE
.RS
.PP
E80x25 Initiates an 80 column by 25 line screen.
.RE
.RS
.PP
userDefined - A user defined string to set an explicit graphics card
mode.
The operation is dependent upon the support offered by the graphics
adapter.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]MEINSTALLPATH\f[R]
is an environment variable that overrides any internally defined search
path for MicroEmacs system macros and defines the root directory(s) of
the MicroEmacs system macros.
The presence of the environment variable affects
.TP
\f[B]MEUSERPATH\f[R]
is an environment variable that defines the users private directory
where user configuration files such as and personal spelling
dictionaries are stored.
This is an absolute directory path.
The environment variable sets the MicroEmacs variable
.TP
\f[B]MEPATH\f[R]
is an environment variable that may be used to define the absolute
search path for MicroEmacs macro files and affects the set\[hy] ting of
$search-path.
The path should include the system macros location(s) and should include
the user directory location as the first path when the environment
variable is not defined.
If $MEUSERPATH is defined then this path name appears before the $MEPATH
variable to define the user directory location.
$MEPATH is not searching, so ALL directories to be searched must be
in\[hy] cluded in the path specification.
.RS
.PP
is the preferred method used to defined the user directory.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]INFOPATH\f[R]
MicroEmacs 2009 uses the environment variable $INFOPATH as the
directory(s) used to search for GNU Info files.
Within the UNIX $INFOPATH is a semi-colon separated list of directories
which are used to search for the MicroEmacs 2009 macro files.
The path is searched from left to right.
The environment variable is typically defined in the in the .login,
\&.cshrc or .pro\[hy] file file i.e.
.RS
.PP
export INFOPATH /usr/local/info:$HOME/info
.RE
.RS
.PP
The default when omitted is /usr/local/info.
.RE
.RS
.PP
Within MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows environments it is defined in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
e.g.
.RE
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
   set MEPATH=c:\[rs]usr\[rs]local\[rs]info
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
There is no default location in these environments.
.RE
.SH FILES
.PP
All of the macro files and dictionaries are located in the MicroEmacs
home directory.
The standard file extensions that are utilized are:-
.PP
\f[I].eaf\f[R] MicroEmacs 2009 abbreviation file, defines completion
definitions for buffer dependent text expansion.
.PP
\f[I].edf\f[R] A MicroEmacs 2009 spelling dictionary.

Drag and drop support is provided in the Windowing version of
MicroEmacs.
The editor window is brought into focus following the drop.
.SH UNIX
.PP
Xdnd drag and drop support is provided in the X-Windows version of
MicroEmacs.
The editor window is not raised or brought into focus following the drop
as expected in the UNIX environment.
.SH SESSIONS
.PP
Reading a session is generally performed when a MicroEmacs session is
started using the \[lq]-c\[rq] command line option rather than from the
mode line or main menu, see Invoking
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
   me -c<mySessionName>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
where is the name of the session (the or system login name) will restore
all of of the buffers, windows layout, point and mark positions, main
window size etc.
at the point of the last shut down.
e.g.\ given a system login name of jasspa then
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
   me -cjasspa
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
restores the session to the state when jasspa last exited MicroEmacs.
When the session name is specified then no other files should be
specified, so the command line
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
   me -cjasspa morefiles.txt
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
restores the buffers but does not restore the window layout because this
has been destroyed by the introduction of the new file
\[lq]morefiles.txt\[rq].
This type of command with another file behaves as the old \[lq]me
-c\[rq] command prior to the 2006 release that did not support sessions.
If is not specified then the buffers are restored but the window layout
is not re\[hy] stored.
.SH HISTORY
.PP
The 2006 release removed the -d command line option for debugging (not
used) and added session support by extending the -c option with an
optional sessionName argument.
