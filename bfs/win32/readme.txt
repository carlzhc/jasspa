This software was developed within the UNIX operating system
environment. In order to port to Microsoft Windows then this
directory contains the files and libraries that do not exist
in the Windows development environment.

The  libraries  and necessary  include files may be obtained
from

    http://www.sourceforge.net

specifically  "libpng"  and  "libz". The tree  contains  the
Microsoft  developer  versions of the library  only. Borland
libraries are available from the aforementioned site (packed
in the Win32 libraries distribution).

The static  versions of the  libraries  are included in this
tree. Note that all  libraries  have the  extension  ".a" as
opposed  to  ".lib"  as may be  expected  under  the  MS-Dev
environment   -  this  follows  the  standard   UNIX  naming
convention for library archive files as generated by the GNU
cross compiler tools.
